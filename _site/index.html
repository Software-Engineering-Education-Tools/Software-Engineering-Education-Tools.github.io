<p>Teaching Software Engineering is hard. For students and for teachers. We try to improve the current way students are thought the basic principles of programming, code quality, collaboration and software design by providing new tools to ease the first steps into these fields. We believe that students, from the very beginning, should work with those tools and processes that are used to build and improve real-life software. Working towards this goal, we provide user-centred, feeback-oriented solutions that accompany, augment and improve existing professional-graded development environments to support software engineering novices in adapting these tools.</p>
